# Theme identity brief — belman-lab-demo

The three candidate designs currently differ only in colour and system font stack.
This brief turns them into three designs with separate identities, using an
established skill rather than a new one.

Settled across five rounds of interview. Execution order is at the bottom.

---

## Step 0 — install the skill

The chosen skill is **`frontend-design` from julianoczkowski/designer-skills**
(Apache-2.0, 542 stars). It is a strict superset of Anthropic's installed
`frontend-design`: same anti-generic clauses, plus eight named aesthetic
philosophies each specified across six axes, plus a mandatory codebase scan
before writing. Already cloned locally but not symlinked, so Claude Code cannot
currently see it.

```sh
git -C /home/inkpotmonkey/code/skills/designer-skills pull
ln -s /home/inkpotmonkey/code/skills/designer-skills/frontend-design \
      ~/.claude/skills/designer-frontend-design
ln -s /home/inkpotmonkey/code/skills/designer-skills/design-review \
      ~/.claude/skills/designer-design-review
```

Renamed on symlink because `~/.claude/skills/frontend-design` already resolves to
Anthropic's. Both stay installed; they are complementary.

Re-read `designer-frontend-design/SKILL.md` after the pull — the constraint block
below was written against commit `d90b927` and the philosophies could have moved.

**No skill in the ecosystem generates N deliberately divergent directions** —
every one commits to a single aesthetic per run. The non-overlap constraint is
therefore supplied by the prompt, not the skill. That is what the shared block is.

---

## Step 1 — shared machinery (no design decisions)

One commit, before any theme work. Nothing here should change how a page looks.

1. **Drop dark mode.** `ThemeSpec.colors` becomes `Record<string, string>` instead
   of `[light, dark]` tuples. `Tokens.astro` stops wrapping values in
   `light-dark()`. `:root { color-scheme: light dark }` becomes `light`.
   Leave `src/admin/index.template.html` untouched — the CMS shell is a tool
   surface, not a candidate design.
2. **Widen `ThemeSpec`** with the identity statement fields:
   `thesis`, `saysAboutYou`, `cost`, `precedent` — all strings. The existing
   one-line `description` stays as the switcher's short form.
3. **Per-theme layout slots.** A theme may supply its own layout and its own
   component variants. Content model, routes and page content stay shared.
4. **Add Fontsource** deps and imports (packages pinned below).
5. **Add a `software` collection** to `src/schema/collections.ts`. One
   declaration flows into both the Zod schema and `public/admin/config.yml`
   through the existing generator. Real content — her GitHub is `sophbel`.
6. **Split the responsive floors** in `scripts/check-responsive.mjs`: touch
   targets to 44px, body text ≥16px on mobile, 12px retained as the floor for
   fine print only.
7. **Add a test** asserting single emission — exactly one `<nav>` primary
   landmark, one identity block, one `<main>` per page, in every theme.
   Precedent: `test/astro-whitespace.test.ts` pins a subtler invariant already.
8. **Rewrite the two prose claims the change invalidates**: the README's "No
   theme has its own stylesheet, which is what keeps the switcher cheap", and the
   `@layer layout` comment in `base.css` about one grid and three arrangements.

## The shared constraint block

Prepend verbatim to each of the three runs.

> ### Stack facts
>
> Astro 7 static site, no framework components. Design tokens are generated:
> `src/lib/themes.ts` declares each theme as a `ThemeSpec`, and
> `src/components/Tokens.astro` emits all themes' tokens into one global
> stylesheet scoped to `:root[data-theme="<id>"]`. `src/styles/base.css` declares
> the cascade layer order `reset, base, layout, components, utilities` and
> consumes the tokens.
>
> **Do not write a parallel stylesheet.** Extend `ThemeSpec`, extend the
> generator, and add `:root[data-theme='x']` rules inside the existing layers.
>
> **`data-theme` means which of the three designs, not colour mode.** The site is
> light-only; there is no dark palette and no `light-dark()`. Ignore the skill's
> instruction to support a `[data-theme="dark"]` attribute — it would fight the
> design switcher.
>
> Type and space are fluid Utopia scales interpolating over 320–1240px, exposed as
> `--step--1`…`--step-5` and `--space-3xs`…`--space-3xl`. Use those tokens; do not
> hard-code px sizes.
>
> ### Typography
>
> Self-hosted via Fontsource npm packages. **Ignore the skill's instruction to
> load fonts from Google Fonts or a CDN**, and ignore its named faces — several
> are commercial (Neue Haas Grotesk, Suisse Intl, Akkurat, Circular, Cera Pro)
> and several of its open suggestions have no variable cut on Fontsource at all
> (Instrument Serif is a single 400 weight; Spectral, DM Serif, Zilla Slab and
> IBM Plex Serif/Mono are static-only). Use only the packages pinned per theme.
>
> Every face must be variable. Three mechanics that fail silently:
>
> - The CSS family name carries a ` Variable` suffix: `'Archivo Variable'`.
> - Italic is always a **separate import** — `@fontsource-variable/x/wght-italic.css`.
>   Body text needs it: the content is full of species names like
>   *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, and a synthesised oblique on these faces looks broken.
> - A bare `import '@fontsource-variable/x'` resolves to the **`wght`-only** build,
>   contrary to the Fontsource docs. To use an optical-size axis, import
>   `opsz.css` **and** `opsz-italic.css`; never mix an `opsz` roman with a `wght`
>   italic.
>
> Weight is exposed as a range on the `@font-face`, so `font-weight: 550`
> interpolates without `font-variation-settings`. Reach for
> `font-variation-settings` only for custom axes (`opsz` applies automatically via
> `font-optical-sizing: auto`).
>
> ### Invariants
>
> - Navigation, identity and `<main>` are each emitted **exactly once** per page.
>   A per-theme layout that emits a second nav puts two "Primary" landmarks and
>   every link twice into the page. A test enforces this.
> - The measure constrains prose, not the column — `--measure` applies to
>   paragraphs and headings, never to a grid container.
> - `pnpm check:responsive` gates every page at 320/390/768/1440: touch targets
>   ≥44px, body text ≥16px on mobile, no text below 12px.
> - `pnpm test` and `pnpm typecheck` pass.
>
> ### What this direction must not take from the others
>
> Six axes. Each direction owns its own value and may not use another's:
>
> | Axis | A — Record | B — Feature | C — Instrument |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | Type classification | Neo-grotesque, one family | Display serif + editorial sans | Monospace + humanist sans |
> | Hue family | Achromatic + vermilion | Warm off-white + lavender/aubergine | Cool monochrome + viridis accent |
> | Layout grammar | Strict modular grid, sidebar | Asymmetric magazine, varied column widths | Dense rail + full-width data zone |
> | Hero treatment | Name + discipline strapline, no image | Question-as-hero over a paper figure | Type-as-hero over a rendered artefact |
> | Motif | The grid made visible — hairline rule system | Real paper figures, citation in caption | A rendered data artefact |
> | Publications dialect | Year-railed list | Annotated "selected findings" cards | Compact citation rows with DOI |
>
> ### Targets
>
> Lead with the science. Put the lab's own name above any institutional
> taxonomy. Give every image a caption and a credit. Let people and research
> reach the reader before media coverage does. Make the page work at 320px first
> and add complexity upward.

## Run A — Record

> Use the designer-frontend-design skill.
>
> [shared constraint block]
>
> Build theme A, "Record", pinned to the **Swiss / International Typographic**
> philosophy from the skill. This is the credibility pole: it should read as
> institutional and objective, the kind of page EMBL-EBI or a Sanger group runs.
> It is the direction Sophie picks if she wants the site to disappear behind the
> work.
>
> Typeface: **Archivo** alone — `@fontsource-variable/archivo` plus
> `/wght-italic.css`. One family used strictly, with weight and scale contrast
> doing the work a second family would otherwise do. Archivo also carries a
> `wdth` axis; check which axis build exposes it and what that costs before
> relying on condensed headlines, and fall back to the `wght` build if the full
> build is heavy.
>
> Palette: achromatic. Paper white, near-black, greys defined by the grid rather
> than by decoration, and exactly one functional accent — a Swiss vermilion.
> Colour is information, never ornament.
>
> Structure: strict modular grid with the gutters visible as part of the design.
> Name and discipline as a two-line strapline unit, repeated as the site's
> signature. A sticky in-page section index above the fold on long pages. Alumni
> collapsed into an accordion on the team page. A funder acronym strip with the
> names spelled out. No photography anywhere except a single credited image.
>
> The trap: Swiss is also the default serious-website answer, so an ordinary
> execution reads as a template rather than a design. Earn it with an unusual
> grid or an unusual ranking of content, and with rules used structurally.
>
> Also write this theme's identity statement into its `ThemeSpec`: `thesis`,
> `saysAboutYou`, `cost` (the honest trade — what she gives up by choosing it),
> and `precedent`.

## Run B — Feature

> Use the designer-frontend-design skill.
>
> [shared constraint block]
>
> Build theme B, "Feature", pinned to the **Editorial / Magazine** philosophy
> from the skill. This is the communication candidate: the site as a place where
> the science is told, not just listed. It is the direction Sophie picks if she
> wants a visitor to understand what she works on within one screen.
>
> Typefaces: **Fraunces** for display — `@fontsource-variable/fraunces/opsz.css`
> and `/opsz-italic.css`, optical size 9–144 covering hero through caption from
> one file — over **Instrument Sans** for body,
> `@fontsource-variable/instrument-sans` plus `/wght-italic.css`. If Fraunces
> renders too soft against the content, substitute `@fontsource-variable/playfair`
> (the superfamily with `opsz` 5–1200, **not** `playfair-display`).
>
> Palette: warm off-white ground, ink black, and **her existing lavender/aubergine
> carried forward** — this is the one direction that keeps continuity with her
> current site, so that continuity becomes something she can actively choose
> rather than something imposed.
>
> Structure: research themes framed as questions rather than topic labels. Real
> paper figures as the imagery system, each with its citation in the caption —
> this is the motif, and it does a job rather than decorating. Varied card sizes
> mirroring a contents page. Pull quotes, hairline rules, kickers. Generous scale
> contrast between display and body.
>
> Placeholder imagery comes from Wikimedia Commons with per-file attribution
> added to `CREDITS.md`, matching how that file already documents borrowing.
> Mark placeholders visibly, as the team page already marks placeholder people.
>
> Also write this theme's identity statement into its `ThemeSpec`: `thesis`,
> `saysAboutYou`, `cost`, `precedent`.

## Run C — Instrument

> Use the designer-frontend-design skill.
>
> [shared constraint block]
>
> Build theme C, "Instrument". The skill has no philosophy that fits, so use this
> authored one in its place — same six axes, same contract:
>
> > **Computational / Instrument.** The site is an instrument the lab built, not
> > a brochure about it. Precision over polish; the data is the ornament.
> >
> > - **Typography**: Monospace carries metadata, navigation, figures and
> >   citations; a humanist sans carries prose. Tabular figures, right-aligned
> >   numbers. Scale contrast is small — hierarchy comes from weight, case and
> >   rules, not size.
> > - **Colour**: Cool near-monochrome, light-first. Exactly one accent, taken
> >   from a scientific colormap so the interface and any rendered data share a
> >   colour language. High data-ink ratio: no gradients, no shadows, no card fills.
> > - **Layout**: A dense metadata rail against a full-width zone the data
> >   artefact can occupy. Content ranked by recency and reproducibility rather
> >   than by prominence.
> > - **Spacing**: Tight and regular. Compression is the point; whitespace is
> >   structural, not luxurious.
> > - **Motion**: Effectively none. State changes are instant.
> > - **Details**: Hairline rules instead of card borders. Monospaced dates and
> >   identifiers. A build or revision line in the footer. "Edit on GitHub"
> >   affordances. Nothing rounded.
>
> Typefaces: **IBM Plex Sans** for prose — `@fontsource-variable/ibm-plex-sans`
> plus `/wght-italic.css` — with **Source Code Pro**,
> `@fontsource-variable/source-code-pro` plus `/wght-italic.css`, carrying
> metadata, navigation and figures. Plex Mono is not variable, which is why the
> mono partner comes from elsewhere.
>
> Structure, and the reason this direction exists: across roughly 24 lab and
> institute sites parsed from raw markup, **live data visualisation is entirely
> absent** — zero canvas or charting libraries, SVGs used only as icons, true
> even of bedford.io. A homepage that renders a real tree, map or dataset is an
> unoccupied position rather than a convention. Take it.
>
> Render the artefact from a **fixture shaped exactly as real data would arrive**,
> stored in `src/data/fixtures/` alongside the existing events and gallery
> fixtures, so wiring real data later is a one-line swap. Label it a placeholder
> as everything else is labelled.
>
> Give **Software and Data top-level navigation parity with Publications**, named
> individually, using the `software` collection added in the shared machinery
> step. The research names this the single fastest separator from a generic
> university template.
>
> Also write this theme's identity statement into its `ThemeSpec`: `thesis`,
> `saysAboutYou`, `cost`, `precedent`.

## Step 5 — surface the identity statements

Extend the existing `designs` section of `src/pages/how-this-works.astro` — the
section is already there, titled "The design switcher" — to render each theme's
four statement fields from `ThemeSpec`. Read them from the theme data rather than
retyping them, the way the rest of that page reads live numbers from the data it
renders. The page is `noindex` and off-menu, which is correct: this is her
decision aid, not a visitor's.

The `cost` line is the point of the exercise. Three sales pitches produce no
decision; naming what each direction gives up is what makes the page usable.

## Step 6 — the gate

```sh
pnpm build && pnpm preview &
pnpm check:responsive
pnpm test && pnpm typecheck
```

Then run **designer-design-review** across all three themes. It is hard-gated on
capturing screenshots of the running application — "code review alone is
insufficient" — which is exactly right here, because the failure mode being fixed
is one that is invisible while reading your own CSS. The question it must answer:
placed side by side, do these three read as three designs or as one design with a
tint control?

## Commit plan

Straight onto `main`, one self-contained change per commit. This is a demo of
what we can build for her, not production work, and `main` deploys on every push
touching `src/**` — so each step goes live as it lands. That is the point: after
commit 5 the live switcher shows one finished design against two unchanged ones,
which is the clearest possible view of what the work buys.

1. `refactor(themes): drop dark mode and widen the theme spec`
2. `build(fonts): self-host variable faces via Fontsource`
3. `feat(schema): add a software collection`
4. `test(responsive): split the body-text and fine-print floors`
5. `feat(themes): give Record a Swiss identity` ← **stop here for review**
6. `feat(themes): give Feature an editorial identity`
7. `feat(themes): give Instrument a computational identity`
8. `feat(site): surface theme identity statements on how-this-works`
9. `docs: describe the per-theme layout architecture`

One theme at a time, and never two at once. Themes B and C must avoid what A
chose; agents working concurrently cannot see each other and would converge on
the same safe answers, which is the failure being corrected. Where a later theme
runs in a fresh session, it honours non-overlap by reading the six-axis matrix
above plus the committed `ThemeSpec` entries of whatever is already built.
